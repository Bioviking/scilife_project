# Scilifelab Summer Project
During the summer of 2017, I took the opportunity to join the KTH's Environmental Genomics group, lead by Anders Andersson, from a bioinformatics project. Know as the Envgen group, they are stations at the biotech research hub Science for Life Laboratory in Stockholm, Sweden.
The goal of this internship was for me to improve my coding skill and my bioinformatic skill




## Project Aim:

In this project: gene expression data will be analysed from surface water samples collected at different time points during three years (2012-2014) at an offshore station east of Ã–land (Station LMO) in the Baltic Sea.

Goals: The dataset may potentially give insights into:

    - how gene expression in the different populations change with environmental conditions,
    - how functional activities varies between taxonomic groups.
    - compare expression levels at the transcript and protein level in bacteria in nature.
