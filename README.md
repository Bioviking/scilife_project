# Scilifelab Summer Project
During the summer of 2017, I took the opportunity to join the KTH's Environmental Genomics group, lead by Anders Andersson, from a bioinformatics project. Know as the Envgen group, they are stations at the biotech research hub Science for Life Laboratory in Stockholm, Sweden.
The goal of this internship was for me to improve my coding skill and my bioinformatic skill
